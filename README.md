# Node on Docker

This is a demo project that will accomplish the following...

1.  Create a virtual machine using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
2.  Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
3.  Set up 3 Docker containers. In these three containers we will run the three primary parts of our application: a
    [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) database, a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) API, and a client web application.
    
## Usage

```
$ vagrant up
$ ./start_app.sh
```
